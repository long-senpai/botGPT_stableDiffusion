Open-sourcing Teiki\nPlease have a look at these articles first to understand what Teiki is:\n\nTeiki: A Decentralized Crowdfunding Protocol\nAI integration on Teiki\nAt Teiki, we pursue transparency and open-source development, which brought us to the blockchain world. We are fully committed to open-source most of our technologies, especially the decentralized works that need absolute transparency.\n\nNevertheless, as a startup, we wish to maintain certain competitive advantages and the freedom to prototype without friction in private. Instead of open-sourcing everything right from the get-go, we will open-source at least a piece every month as things mature.\n\nFor instance, our open-sourcing roadmap for Teiki is as follows:\n\n2022 Dec: Teiki Protocol\n2023 Jan: Teiki Index\n2023 Feb: Teiki Backend\n2023 Mar: Teiki Frontend\n2023 Apr: Teiki AI\n2023 May: Teiki Protocol Gen II\nWe publish the protocol first at each generation cycle as it needs transparency the most. The cost of on-chain compromises and migrations is deadly, so early discussions and reviews with the community are critical.\n\nWe publish our AI works last as it takes time to refine model architectures and training. They are also significant competitive advantages against other crowdfunding solutions in both cryptocurrency and fiat markets.\n\nThe R&D company behind Teiki, Shinka Network, also expects to have ad-hoc publishing as things like Facelift mature. These recurrent announcements should remind everyone to go open-source!\n\nWorking with the Community\n\nWe are standing on the shoulders of other open-source projects. Helios, Lucid, and Ogmios helped us prototype Teiki much faster. The Cardano blockchain, TypeScript, and much more are in the same category. Indeed, open-source software embraces public collaboration. Please join us and drive Teiki forward together!\n\nTo further deepen the commitment, we will freely feature open-source projects on the Teiki app and provide marketing support to help them raise recurrent funding. On top of our heroes at Helios, Lucid, and Ogmios, we would love to work with other projects making Cardano development more friendly and productive, like Aiken and Carp. Once our AI stack is mature, we would love to do the same for the open-source AI community.\n\nLet us do this!
