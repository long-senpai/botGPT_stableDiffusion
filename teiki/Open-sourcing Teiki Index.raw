Open-sourcing Teiki Index\n\nThe Spirit of Open-Source\nTransparency and open-source development brought us at Teiki to blockchain in the first place. As such, weâ€™re fully committed to open-sourcing most of our technology: absolute transparency is essential to anything built to be decentralised.\n\nThatâ€™s why weâ€™ve established an open-sourcing roadmap. By open-sourcing at least one piece of our tech every month in pace with our ongoing development work, we gain the freedom to prototype without friction in private, and we maintain our advantage as an agile start-up developing at the cutting edge of the blockchain industry.\n\nIn December 2022, we open-sourced the Teiki protocol. And weâ€™ve just marked the end of January 2023 by open-sourcing the Teiki Index! ðŸŽ‰\n\nGitHub - teiki-network/teiki-index: Teiki index implementation in Generation I\nTeiki index implementation in Generation I teiki-index depends on a few other services: A minimal, working setup to getâ€¦\ngithub.com\n\nWhat does the Teiki Index do?\nA blockchain indexer transforms raw chain data into more structured forms, allowing apps to query data much faster. For example, to find out how many projects are created on Teiki, an indexer can watch the chain and add +1 whenever there is a new project creation transaction. Without an indexer, an app would need to re-count all the creation transactions from the beginning of the blockchain history every time.\n\nAside from UI data rendered on the screen, indexers help apps query data to build transactions. For example, an app needs to know the backing UTxO to build a transaction withdrawing it for the Backer.\n\nOpen-sourcing the Teiki Index allows everyone to query protocol data in SQL easily. For instance, after spinning up the indexing infrastructure with a simple docker-compose up command, one can start querying and playing with our testnet data.\n\nteiki=# \dt chain.*\n                List of relations\n Schema |        Name        | Type  |   Owner\n--------+--------------------+-------+------------\n chain  | backing            | table | postgres\n chain  | block              | table | postgres\n chain  | dedicated_treasury | table | postgres\n chain  | open_treasury      | table | postgres\n chain  | output             | table | postgres\n chain  | project            | table | postgres\n chain  | project_detail     | table | postgres\n chain  | project_script     | table | postgres\n chain  | protocol_params    | table | postgres\n chain  | script             | table | postgres\n chain  | shared_treasury    | table | postgres\n chain  | teiki_plant        | table | postgres\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nteiki=# select max(total_backing_amount) from views.project_summary;\n     max\n-------------\n 85944500003\n(1 row)\nFinally, we wrote a lightweight indexing framework to adapt to unique needs. Unlike an existing tool that only indexes chain data, we also index IPFS data, run it through OCR and moderation models, shoot Discord alerts to handle potentially inappropriate content, and more.\n\nShout-out to Ogmios for providing the chain interface and TypeScript client! ðŸ”¥\n\nWhatâ€™s Next?\nIn the coming months, weâ€™ll open-source the rest of Teiki Gen Iâ€™s tech:\n\nTeiki Backend in February.\nTeiki Frontend in March.\nTeiki AI in April.\nSoon enough, anyone will be able to build custom Teiki front-ends and integrations for specialised use cases. For example, a developer can build a UI to connect musicians and their fans, minting exclusive Backer-only NFTs when backing. Other possibilities include the ability to build embedded UI components for users to back dApps straight from the dApp itself, e.g. at https://app.indigoprotocol.io.\n\nAlong with Transparency, Teiki is committed to practising and promoting Decentralisation and Composability, all true values of the blockchain.\n\nLetâ€™s co-grow the future of decentralized crowdfunding on our testnet!
