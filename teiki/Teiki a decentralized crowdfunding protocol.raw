Teiki: A Decentralized Crowdfunding Protocol  Problems The Cardano ecosystem has much room for development and certainly needs more builders. With Cardano’s Proof-of-Stake, ADA stakers reap a reward every five days at a 3–4% APY. However, the majority of ADA staked on Cardano is not used to develop the ecosystem. At the same time, innovative projects find it hard to raise funds during the bear market.  What can we do about this?  Teiki Teiki is a decentralized crowdfunding protocol initially built on Cardano and IPFS. The protocol has high degrees of decentralization and low transaction fees. We utilize Cardano’s liquid staking to build a novel subscription model, where backers stake ADA at Teiki Smart Contracts to generate rewards for project creators.  To reduce friction, Teiki integrates AI models so projects can automatically generate names, taglines, keywords, logos, cover pictures, text from images, and summarize texts. Teiki has content moderation AI to remove the need for a long review process. We integrate Grammarly and sentiment analysis to improve creator writings. For backers, Teiki automatically summarizes and recommends content and generates podcasts to improve the browsing experience. In future generations, Teiki will integrate even more AI for generating one-pagers, community-management chatbots, and more.  Projects launching on Teiki must meet specific requirements prohibiting scams, impersonation, political activities, NSFW content, and more. The development team first sets the rules before decentralizing the process to on-chain voting in later generations. Teiki encourages creators to update progress regularly and stay close to their community. More information will be detailed in our Creator’s Handbook once published.  At Teiki, we pursue decentralization. The creators fully control the delegation of their backers’ staked ADA. Nevertheless, to reduce friction, creators can delegate the task to Teiki, who is committed to delegating ADA to single stake pools. In summary, we are building a future where holders stake ADA for innovation, and Teiki spreads staked ADA across single stake pools for decentralization.  Subscription Model  Teiki’s crowdfunding mechanism is a subscription model built on Cardano’s liquid staking, where backers stake ADA at smart contracts to generate rewards for project creators. Backers can withdraw their stake at any time, especially when a project fails to progress. Since they do not withdraw rewards before sending payments to creators, backers potentially avoid an income tax. In return for giving up their ADA stake rewards, backers get back $TEIKI tokens and the rewards that a project promises. All funds are secure, transparent, and verifiable on the blockchain.  Tokenomics $TEIKI is the governance token of Teiki.   We strive to create a high-utility and equitable token representing the contributed effort of the protocol, projects, and backers.  Therefore, $TEIKI is non-pre-minted and does not have a max supply. The protocol only mints $TEIKI when a project meets a fundraising milestone. When minted, $TEIKI is shared equally between the protocol treasury, project, and backers. Only the backers’ portions are liquid. The protocol treasury locks the tokens until Gen II, and the project’s portion is gradually burned in one year. Locked tokens are eligible for governance.  There will only be $TEIKI if there is successful funding in the protocol. The number of $TEIKI tokens is proportional to the total values created on the protocol.  For Project Creators  Anyone can launch a project on Teiki if they meet the following pre-requisites:  Have a Cardano Wallet. Have over 500 ADA to lock as a pledge and pay transaction fees. The project does not violate Teiki rules (e.g., running political campaigns), else the project will be closed and fined the pledge. To create a project, the creator fills in project details, such as the description, logo, milestones, and social media. To reduce friction, Teiki AI helps creators generate names, taglines, keywords, logos, cover pictures, text from images, and summarize texts.  Once submitted, the Cardano blockchain and IPFS store the project details with absolute transparency. Once created, new projects gain built-in functionalities through parameterized scripts on Cardano and are ready to raise funding and build a community.  We aim to reduce this process from weeks on traditional platforms to days in the Teiki App.  For Backers  Backers are ADA holders seeking to foster innovation, especially in the Cardano ecosystem. Backers only need a Cardano Wallet with ADA to interact with the Teiki protocol. By giving up ADA stake rewards to support projects, backers get rewarded liquid $TEIKI once the project meets a funding raising. Projects usually provide further rewards and perks for their community to stay competitive.  In later generations, Teiki will provide built-in governance functionalities for projects that only backers and project token holders can join.  Conclusion Teiki is a decentralized crowdfunding protocol that fosters innovation. We embrace AI to maximize user experience and competitive advantages. The governance token is non-pre-minted and highly equitable. With core values in decentralization and transparency, Teiki starts in the Cardano ecosystem before expanding to broader markets.
