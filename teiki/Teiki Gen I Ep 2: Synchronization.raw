Teiki Gen I Ep 2: Synchronization\n\nIntroduction\nWhen we launched our testnet on January 16, Teiki opened up limitless opportunities for Creators to experiment with decentralised crowdfunding.\n\nWe strive to maintain a lively testnet and foster a strong sense of community collaboration. Anyone can report bugs or provide feedback on our Discord server. As an added incentive, we offer a pool of 20,000 ADA as a reward for valuable product feedback.\n\nThe current state of the Teiki testnet allows creators to raise funds to build while backers provide a revenue stream to support shared missions. Our second week on the testnet introduces features to enhance this synchronization further.\n\nIn principle, Teiki incentivizes projects to provide recurrent updates to their community. Trust and transparency are essential for successful fundraising.\n\nEpisode 2: Synchronization\nUpdate Project\n\nOnce a project has been created on Teiki, the creator may wish to modify it. This may be updating the project description, adding a seasonal banner, delaying a milestone, updating FAQs, etc.\n\nThe same create-project editor is used to update the project. Kindly refer to Teiki Gen I Ep 1: Enter Teiki for the editing process and interface.\n\n\n\nPost An Announcement\n\nNot all project updates are the same! Creators can highlight critical updates by posting them as Announcements and explain to their Backers in detail about significant developments.\n\n\n\nBackers can find these important announcements on the project detail page. Since data on Cardano and IPFS are public and immutable, any project change can be verified for transparency and trust.\n\n\nPodcasts\nTeiki aggregates announcements across different projects into podcasts, connecting Backers to projects they love and others they might not have heard of. We offer both categorized (hot announcements, grouped by popular tags, etc.) and personalized (from backing and following projects, projects one may like, etc.) podcasts.\n\nSoon enough, Teiki users can explore and synchronize with project movements while on the train, driving, or in the shower.\n\n\nIn the future, podcasts will be read by Niko’s fine-tuned voice, with auto-generated background music, sound effects, smooth transitions, and more. The goal is to produce quality announcements from minimal inputs while creators have more time to build.\n\nLet’s create a project today to post announcements for next week! https://testnet.teiki.network
